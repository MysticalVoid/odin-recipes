    <h2>Sweet cream of beans with vanilla cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Sweet cream of beans is a Dominican dessert made with beans, milk, coconut milk, sweet potato, raisins, and spices. The result is a sweet and creamy dessert, similar to a cold soup, that is served with our iconic milk crackers and toasted cassava (a flatbread made from cassava flour).
